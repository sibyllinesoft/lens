# Legacy Implementation Snapshot

Historical JavaScript/TypeScript and Python assets that previously lived under
`src/`, `scripts/`, and related directories have been removed from the active
workspace. Refer to commit history prior to this cleanup if you need to inspect
those files. Keeping them out of the main tree avoids tripping repository
policy checks while making it clear that the Rust workspace is authoritative.
