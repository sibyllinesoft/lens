## üìä Monitoring Dashboard Requirements

### Real-time Metrics:
```yaml
Counterfactual Quality:
  - ESS/N ratio (target: >0.2, ideal: >0.8)
  - Pareto Œ∫ (target: <0.5)
  - Negative control p-values (target: >0.05)

Gating Performance:  
  - Coverage rate (target: 14-16%)
  - nDCG lift per reranked query
  - Latency p95 vs budget

Conformal Prediction:
  - Empirical coverage (target: 93-97%)
  - Prediction interval width
  - Coverage by cache type (warm/cold)

Router Performance:
  - INT8 policy vs full model gap
  - Inference latency (target: <1ms)
  - Monotonicity violations (target: 0)
```

### Alerting Thresholds:
```yaml
CRITICAL Alerts:
  - ESS/N < 0.2 (sampling quality degraded)
  - Conformal coverage < 90% or > 98% (miscalibration)
  - Latency p95 > SLA + 20% (constraint violation)

WARNING Alerts:  
  - Coverage rate outside 12-18% (gating drift)
  - Negative control p-value < 0.05 (confounding detected)
  - Router performance gap > 0.05pp (no-regret violation)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Plan

### Rollback Triggers:
```yaml
Immediate Rollback Required:
  - nDCG regression >0.1pp from T‚ÇÅ baseline
  - Latency SLA violations >5% of requests  
  - ESS quality collapse (ratio <0.1)
  - System instability or errors >1%

Gradual Rollback (24h window):
  - Conformal coverage drift outside 90-98%
  - Gating strategy underperformance  
  - OOD robustness failures
```

### Rollback Procedure:
1. **Traffic reduction**: 100% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 0%
2. **Metric monitoring**: Track recovery at each step
3. **Root cause analysis**: Identify failure mode
4. **Hot fix deployment**: If issue isolated and fixable
5. **Full investigation**: If architectural issue detected
