## 🔮 NEXT 14 DAYS

### **Automated Processes**
The system will now autonomously:
1. **Monitor Performance**: 6-hourly snapshots of all configurations
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Continuous SPRT validation and confidence intervals
3. **Ablation Testing**: Ongoing sensitivity analysis for each configuration
4. **Packet Sealing**: Automatic sealing when N≥1000 samples achieved
5. **Promotion Decisions**: Real-time evaluation against strict SLO gates

### **Expected Outcomes**
Based on the initial ablation sensitivity results:
- **High-Sensitivity Configs** (>13%): Strong candidates for promotion if SLO-compliant
- **Medium-Sensitivity Configs** (10-13%): Moderate promotion probability
- **Low-Sensitivity Configs** (<10%): Will require extended monitoring
