===========================

Based on its plotting functionality, Matplotlib also provides an interface to
generate animations using the `~matplotlib.animation` module. An
animation is a sequence of frames where each frame corresponds to a plot on a
`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`. This tutorial covers a general guideline on
how to create such animations and the different options available.
