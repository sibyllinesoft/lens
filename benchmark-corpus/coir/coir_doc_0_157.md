# Database Connection Pooling (Variant 157)

Database connection pooling is a method used to keep cache of database connections that can be reused across multiple requests. This technique improves application performance by eliminating the overhead of establishing and tearing down database connections for each query.

Key benefits include:
- Reduced connection establishment overhead
- Better resource utilization
- Improved scalability under high load
- Connection lifecycle management

Common implementations include HikariCP for Java, pgbouncer for PostgreSQL, and connection pools in web frameworks.

## Best Practices

Consider performance implications when implementing this approach.
