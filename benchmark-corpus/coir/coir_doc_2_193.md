# Microservices Architecture Patterns (Variant 193)

Microservices architecture breaks applications into small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Key patterns include:

Service Discovery: Services register and discover each other dynamically
Circuit Breaker: Prevent cascade failures by monitoring service health
Event Sourcing: Store changes as sequence of events
CQRS: Separate read and write operations
Saga Pattern: Manage distributed transactions

Benefits include independent deployment, technology diversity, and fault isolation.
Challenges include distributed system complexity, data consistency, and operational overhead.

## Best Practices

Consider performance implications when implementing this approach.
