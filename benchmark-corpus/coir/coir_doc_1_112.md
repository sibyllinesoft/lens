# RESTful API Design Principles (Variant 112)

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. Key principles include:

1. Stateless Communication: Each request must contain all necessary information
2. Resource-Based URLs: Use nouns to represent resources (/users, /orders)
3. HTTP Methods: Use appropriate verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
4. Uniform Interface: Consistent naming and structure
5. Hypermedia Controls: Links to related resources

Example endpoint design:
GET /api/users/{id} - Retrieve user
POST /api/users - Create user
PUT /api/users/{id} - Update user
DELETE /api/users/{id} - Delete user

## Implementation Notes

This pattern is commonly used in enterprise applications.
