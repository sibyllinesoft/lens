# Caching Strategies and Patterns (Variant 0)

Caching improves application performance by storing frequently accessed data in fast storage. Common strategies:

Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading): Application manages cache explicitly
Write-Through: Write to cache and database simultaneously  
Write-Behind: Write to cache first, database asynchronously
Refresh-Ahead: Proactively refresh cache before expiration

Cache levels:
- Browser cache: Client-side caching
- CDN: Geographic content distribution
- Application cache: In-memory data storage
- Database cache: Query result caching

Considerations include cache invalidation, consistency, and memory management.

## Implementation Notes

This pattern is commonly used in enterprise applications.
