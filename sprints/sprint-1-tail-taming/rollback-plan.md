# Sprint #1: Rollback Plan & Procedures

## Rollback Philosophy

**Priority 1:** User experience and system stability  
**Priority 2:** Data integrity and measurement continuity  
**Priority 3:** Sprint progress and learning capture

**Core Principle:** "Better to rollback quickly and learn than persist with degraded performance"

## Rollback Triggers

### Automated Rollback (No Human Intervention)

#### Trigger 1: Critical Error Rate
- **Condition:** Total error rate > 0.5% sustained for 2+ minutes
- **Response Time:** <30 seconds automated rollback
- **Rationale:** User-facing impact requires immediate intervention

#### Trigger 2: Severe Latency Degradation  
- **Condition:** p99 latency increases >15% from baseline for 5+ minutes
- **Response Time:** <60 seconds automated rollback
- **Rationale:** SLA compliance at risk, user experience degrading

#### Trigger 3: Resource Exhaustion
- **Condition:** Any shard exceeds 95% CPU or memory for 3+ minutes
- **Response Time:** <30 seconds automated rollback
- **Rationale:** System stability at risk, potential cascade failure

### Manual Rollback (Human Decision Required)

#### Trigger 4: Success Gate Failure
- **Condition:** Any primary success gate fails during canary testing
- **Decision Time:** Sprint DRI has 5 minutes to decide
- **Default Action:** Rollback if no decision made in 5 minutes
- **Rationale:** Sprint objectives not being met

#### Trigger 5: Quality Regression
- **Condition:** nDCG@10 drops below 0.5184 (>0.005 from baseline)
- **Decision Time:** QA DRI has 10 minutes to investigate and decide
- **Default Action:** Rollback if not resolved in 30 minutes
- **Rationale:** Search quality impact on users

#### Trigger 6: Operational Anomaly
- **Condition:** Unexpected behavior patterns or monitoring blind spots
- **Decision Authority:** Any Sprint DRI can initiate manual rollback
- **Response Time:** Variable based on severity assessment
- **Rationale:** Unknown risks require conservative approach

## Rollback Procedures

### Phase 1: Traffic Reversion (0-60 seconds)

#### Step 1: Emergency Stop (0-10 seconds)
1. **Access:** SSH to load balancer or use web console
2. **Command:** `traffic-split --treatment 0 --control 100`
3. **Validation:** Confirm 0% traffic routing to treatment
4. **Notification:** Automated alert to #sprint-1-channel

#### Step 2: Configuration Revert (10-30 seconds)
1. **Hedging Service:** `systemctl stop hedging-service`
2. **TA/NRA Algorithm:** `config-update --disable-early-stop`
3. **Feature Flags:** `feature-flag --disable hedging ta_nra_optimization`
4. **Cache Clear:** `redis-cli FLUSHDB` (configuration cache only)

#### Step 3: Health Validation (30-60 seconds)
1. **Error Rate Check:** Verify <0.1% error rate within 30 seconds
2. **Latency Check:** Confirm p99 latency returns to baseline within 60 seconds
3. **Resource Check:** Validate CPU/memory utilization drops to normal
4. **Traffic Check:** Confirm 100% traffic on baseline configuration

### Phase 2: System Stabilization (1-5 minutes)

#### Step 4: Deep Health Validation
1. **End-to-End Testing:** Run automated smoke tests
2. **Quality Metrics:** Verify nDCG@10 returns to baseline range
3. **SLA Compliance:** Confirm SLA-Recall@50 at expected levels
4. **Resource Monitoring:** Extended observation of system health

#### Step 5: Stakeholder Notification
1. **Engineering Team:** Detailed rollback notification with metrics
2. **Product Team:** Impact assessment and user-facing implications  
3. **Leadership:** Executive summary if business impact occurred
4. **Customer Comms:** Customer notification if SLA breach occurred

### Phase 3: Investigation & Recovery (5+ minutes)

#### Step 6: Root Cause Analysis
1. **Log Collection:** Gather logs from treatment period
2. **Metric Analysis:** Compare treatment vs control metrics
3. **Timeline Reconstruction:** Map events leading to rollback
4. **Hypothesis Formation:** Identify most likely failure causes

#### Step 7: Recovery Planning
1. **Issue Prioritization:** Rank problems by severity and complexity
2. **Fix Development:** Create remediation plan with timelines
3. **Testing Strategy:** Plan for re-deployment with additional safeguards
4. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate remaining sprint timeline and goals

## Rollback Decision Matrix

### Canary Phase Rollback Decisions

| Condition | 5% Traffic | 25% Traffic | 50% Traffic | 100% Traffic |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Error rate >0.5% | Auto rollback | Auto rollback | Auto rollback | Auto rollback |
| p99 increase >15% | Auto rollback | Auto rollback | Auto rollback | Auto rollback |
| Resource >95% | Auto rollback | Auto rollback | Auto rollback | Auto rollback |
| Gate failure | Manual (5 min) | Manual (2 min) | Auto rollback | Auto rollback |
| nDCG drop >0.005 | Manual (10 min) | Manual (5 min) | Manual (2 min) | Auto rollback |

### Decision Authority Matrix

| Trigger Type | 5% Canary | 25% Canary | 50% Canary | 100% Rollout |
|--------------|-----------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Automated | System | System | System | System |
| Performance Gates | Sprint DRI | Sprint DRI | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager |
| Quality Gates | QA DRI | QA DRI | QA DRI + Sprint DRI | Engineering Manager |
| Business Impact | Sprint PM | Sprint PM | Engineering Manager | VP Engineering |

## Rollback Testing

### Pre-deployment Validation
- **Staging Rollback:** Test rollback procedures in staging environment
- **Procedure Walkthrough:** Team rehearsal of rollback steps
- **Authority Confirmation:** Verify decision-making authority and contact info
- **Tool Access:** Confirm all team members have necessary system access

### During Deployment
- **5% Canary:** Practice manual rollback during low-risk phase  
- **Rollback Drill:** Intentional rollback test during maintenance window
- **Response Time:** Measure actual rollback execution time vs targets
- **Communication:** Validate notification systems and escalation paths

## Post-Rollback Procedures
