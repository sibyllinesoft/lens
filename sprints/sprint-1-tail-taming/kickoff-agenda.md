# Sprint #1: Tail-taming Kickoff Agenda (30 minutes)

**Date:** Monday, September 9, 2025  
**Time:** 9:00-9:30 AM  
**Attendees:** Backend Engineering, Search Engineering, QA Engineering, PM

## Agenda

### 1. Sprint Overview (5 minutes)
- **Objective:** Reduce p99 by 10-15% while holding recall
- **Duration:** 2 weeks (Sept 9-23)
- **Background:** Gap analysis identified 1,781 timeout_handling queries
- **Business Impact:** Improved user experience, higher query throughput

### 2. Technical Approach (10 minutes)

**Lever 1: Hedged Probes + Cooperative Cancel**
- Send duplicate request to slowest shard at p95+δ threshold
- Cancel losing requests immediately to conserve resources
- Expected p99 reduction: 12-18%, cost impact: +3-4%

**Lever 2: Cross-shard TA/NRA + Learning-to-stop**
- Implement threshold algorithm with cross-shard bound sharing
- Add early stopping when top-K results converge
- Expected p99 reduction: 8-12%, cost impact: -1-2%

### 3. Success Gates & Validation (5 minutes)
- **Primary:** p99 -10-15%, SLA-Recall@50 ≥ 0, QPS +10-15%, cost ≤ +5%
- **Quality:** nDCG within ±0.005, p99/p95 ≤ 2.0, error rate ≤ 0.1%
- **Measurement:** A/A testing, 5→25→50→100% canary rollout

### 4. Team Assignments & DRIs (5 minutes)
- **Backend Engineering:** Hedging + cancellation implementation
- **Search Engineering:** TA/NRA + early stopping logic
- **QA Engineering:** Gate validation + rollback procedures
- **PM:** Sprint coordination + stakeholder communication

### 5. Dashboard & Monitoring Setup (3 minutes)
- **Primary:** p50/p95/p99, tail ratio, SLA-Recall@50, QPS@150ms
- **Operational:** timeout share per shard, resource utilization
- **Validation:** All dashboards live before code deployment

### 6. Rollback & Risk Management (2 minutes)
- **Automated rollback** if gates fail during canary
- **Manual rollback** capability within 30 seconds
- **Escalation path:** Sprint DRIs → Engineering Manager → VP Eng

## Action Items

### Immediate (Today)
- [ ] Assign DRIs for Backend, Search, and QA workstreams
- [ ] Validate dashboard access and metric collection
- [ ] Confirm A/A testing infrastructure is ready

### This Week
- [ ] Complete hedging service implementation (Backend)
- [ ] Complete TA/NRA algorithm implementation (Search)
- [ ] Complete gate validation framework (QA)
- [ ] Execute A/A testing and baseline validation (All)

### Next Week
- [ ] Execute canary rollout with gate validation
- [ ] Monitor success metrics and quality gates
- [ ] Complete full rollout if gates pass
- [ ] Generate sprint completion report

## Meeting Notes

**DRI Assignments:**
- Backend Engineering (Hedging): [Name TBD]
- Search Engineering (TA/NRA): [Name TBD]  
- QA Engineering (Gates): [Name TBD]

**Dashboard Confirmation:**
- [ ] Latency dashboards accessible and updating
- [ ] SLA-Recall metrics collecting properly
- [ ] Resource utilization monitoring active
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured for rollback triggers

**Risk Assessment:**
- **High Risk:** Core search algorithm changes (TA/NRA)
- **Medium Risk:** New hedging coordination logic
- **Low Risk:** Measurement and validation infrastructure

**Next Meeting:** Sprint checkpoint, Friday Sept 13 @ 2:00 PM
