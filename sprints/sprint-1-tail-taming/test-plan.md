- **Data completeness:** >99.9% query logging and metric collection

### A/A Test Metrics
- p50, p95, p99 latency (should be identical)
- nDCG@10, SLA-Recall@50 (should be identical)
- Error rates, timeout rates (should be identical) 
- Resource utilization (should be identical)

### Validation Schedule
- **Day 1:** Deploy A/A configuration, validate traffic split
- **Day 2:** Collect 24 hours of A/A data, analyze for bias
- **Day 3:** Confirm A/A results, prepare for canary testing

## Phase 2: Canary Testing (Days 4-10)

### 5% Traffic Canary (Days 4-5)

**Purpose:** Basic functionality validation and early signal detection

**Configuration:**

- TA/NRA algorithm executes correctly
- No immediate performance degradation
- Error rates remain within normal bounds

**Success Gates:**
- Error rate ≤ 0.1% (same as baseline)
- No timeout increases > 5%
- Hedging cancellation success > 85%
- Early stopping rate 15-45% (healthy range)

### 25% Traffic Canary (Days 6-7)

**Purpose:** Performance measurement with statistical significance

**Configuration:**

**Purpose:** Complete deployment and sustained performance validation

**Configuration:**
- 100% traffic → treatment (hedging + TA/NRA)
- Baseline comparison via historical metrics from v2.2

**Monitoring Intensity:**
- **First 4 hours:** 5-minute measurement windows
- **Next 20 hours:** 15-minute measurement windows  
- **Remaining time:** 1-hour measurement windows

**Success Gates:**
- All gates pass consistently for 24+ hours
- No degradation trends or concerning patterns
- User-facing metrics show expected improvements

### Observation Period (Days 13-14)

**Purpose:** Confirm sustained benefits and operational stability

**Activities:**

- **Effect size:** Cohen's d for practical significance assessment
- **Power analysis:** Retrospective power calculation validation

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- **Error rate spike:** >0.5% for >2 minutes
- **Latency spike:** p99 increase >10% for >5 minutes
- **Resource exhaustion:** Any shard >95% CPU/memory for >3 minutes

### Manual Rollback Process
1. **Detection:** Alert fired or manual observation of gate failure
2. **Decision:** Sprint DRI confirms rollback necessity (< 2 minutes)
3. **Execution:** Traffic routing reverted to 100% control (< 30 seconds)
4. **Validation:** Confirm metrics return to baseline (< 5 minutes)
5. **Investigation:** Root cause analysis and remediation plan

### Rollback Testing
- **Pre-deployment:** Validate rollback mechanism in staging
- **During canary:** Practice rollback during 5% phase
- **Documentation:** Step-by-step runbook with contact information
