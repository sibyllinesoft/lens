# Sprint #1: Tail-taming Operations Brief

## 🎯 Objective
**Reduce p99 latency by 10-15% while maintaining SLA-Recall@50 ≥ v2.2 baseline**

## 📊 Current Baseline (v2.2)
- **p99 latency:** 145ms (within 150ms SLA)
- **p99/p95 ratio:** 1.03
- **SLA-Recall@50:** 0.8234
- **QPS @ 150ms:** 2,847 queries/second
- **Cost per query:** $0.0023

## 🔧 Technical Levers

### Lever 1: Hedged Probes + Cooperative Cancel
**Owner:** TBD - Backend Engineering  
**Description:** Send late clone to slowest shard at p95+δ; cancel losers immediately  

**Implementation Plan:**
- Week 1: Implement hedging service with configurable δ threshold
- Week 1: Add cooperative cancellation protocol between shards
- Week 2: A/B test with δ=[5ms, 10ms, 15ms] configurations
- Week 2: Optimize cancellation timing and resource cleanup

**Expected Impact:**
- p99 reduction: 12-18%
- Additional cost: +3-4% (duplicate requests)
- Implementation risk: Medium (new coordination logic)

### Lever 2: Cross-shard TA/NRA + Learning-to-stop
**Owner:** TBD - Search Engineering  
**Description:** Tighten upper-bound sharing and stop early when top-K stable  

**Implementation Plan:**
- Week 1: Implement threshold algorithm (TA) with cross-shard bounds
- Week 1: Add no-random-access (NRA) mode for expensive operations
- Week 2: Implement learning-to-stop with top-K stability detection
- Week 2: Tune stopping conditions and convergence thresholds

**Expected Impact:**
- p99 reduction: 8-12%
- Cost reduction: -1-2% (fewer operations)
- Implementation risk: High (core search logic changes)

## 🚧 Success Gates (Block Promotion If Fail)

### Primary Gates
- ✅ **p99 latency:** -10% to -15% vs v2.2 baseline
- ✅ **SLA-Recall@50:** Δ ≥ 0 vs v2.2 (no degradation)
- ✅ **QPS @ 150ms:** +10% to +15% improvement
- ✅ **Cost impact:** ≤ +5% vs v2.2 baseline

### Quality Gates  
- ✅ **nDCG@10:** Within ±0.005 of v2.2 (no quality regression)
- ✅ **p99/p95 ratio:** ≤ 2.0 (tail behavior remains healthy)
- ✅ **Error rate:** ≤ 0.1% (reliability maintained)
- ✅ **A/A test:** Passes statistical significance tests

## 📈 Dashboards to Watch

### Primary Metrics
1. **Latency Distribution:** p50, p95, p99 with 5-minute resolution
2. **Tail Ratio:** p99/p95 trending over time
3. **SLA Compliance:** Queries within 150ms, recall at cutoff
4. **Throughput:** QPS at various SLA thresholds

### Operational Metrics
1. **Timeout Share:** Per-shard timeout rates and patterns
2. **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, network per shard
3. **Cancellation Efficiency:** Hedge cancellation success rates
4. **Early Stop Rate:** TA/NRA early termination frequency

## 🧪 Test Plan

### Phase 1: A/A Testing (Days 1-3)
- Deploy identical configurations to treatment/control
- Validate measurement infrastructure and statistical tests
- Confirm no drift or bias in baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Canary Rollout (Days 4-10)
- **5% traffic:** Initial validation of lever implementations
- **25% traffic:** Scale testing and performance validation  
- **50% traffic:** Full load testing and stability validation

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Days 11-14)
- **100% traffic:** Complete deployment if all gates pass
- **Monitoring:** 48-hour observation period
- **Rollback:** Automated if any gate fails

### Rollback Triggers
- p99 latency increase > 5%
- SLA-Recall@50 drop > 0.01
- Error rate > 0.5%
- Resource utilization > 95%
