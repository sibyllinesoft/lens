## 2. QUALITY ASSURANCE GATES (Block promotion if fail)

### Gate 2.1: nDCG@10 Preservation
**Requirement:** Within ±0.005 of v2.2 baseline  
**Baseline:** 0.5234 nDCG@10 (span-only)  
**Target Range:** 0.5184-0.5284 nDCG@10  
**Measurement:** Same pooled qrels and SLA mask as v2.2  
**Pass Condition:** 95% CI entirely within target range

### Gate 2.2: Tail Behavior Health
**Requirement:** p99/p95 ratio ≤ 2.0  
**Baseline:** 1.03 p99/p95 ratio  
**Target:** ≤ 2.0 p99/p95 ratio  
**Measurement:** Rolling 15-minute windows during peak traffic  
**Pass Condition:** p99/p95 never exceeds 2.0 for >5 minutes

### Gate 2.3: Error Rate Stability
**Requirement:** ≤ 0.1% error rate  
**Baseline:** 0.03% error rate  
**Target:** ≤ 0.1% error rate  
**Measurement:** HTTP 5xx responses + timeout exceptions  
**Pass Condition:** Error rate ≤ 0.1% in all measurement windows

### Gate 2.4: A/A Test Validity
**Requirement:** No statistical significance in A/A comparison  
**Target:** p-value > 0.05 for all primary metrics  
**Measurement:** Identical configurations in treatment/control  
**Pass Condition:** All A/A tests show no significant difference

## 3. OPERATIONAL STABILITY GATES

### Gate 3.1: Resource Utilization
**Requirement:** CPU/Memory ≤ 85% sustained  
**Measurement:** Per-shard resource monitoring  
**Pass Condition:** No shard exceeds 85% for >10 minutes

### Gate 3.2: Cancellation Efficiency (Hedging)
**Requirement:** >90% hedge cancellation success  
**Measurement:** Cancelled requests / total hedge requests  
**Pass Condition:** Cancellation rate >90% during steady state

### Gate 3.3: Early Stop Rate (TA/NRA)
**Requirement:** 20-40% early termination rate  
**Measurement:** Queries stopped early / total queries  
**Pass Condition:** Early stop rate in healthy range (not too low/high)

## Gate Validation Timeline

### Phase 1: A/A Testing (Days 1-3)
- Validate all measurement infrastructure
- Confirm baseline metrics match v2.2 fingerprint
- Ensure no systematic bias in treatment/control assignment

### Phase 2: Canary Testing (Days 4-10)
- **5% traffic:** Basic functionality and error rate gates
- **25% traffic:** Performance gates with statistical power
- **50% traffic:** All gates validated under realistic load

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Days 11-14)
- **100% traffic:** Complete gate validation
- **48-hour observation:** Sustained performance confirmation
- **Success declaration:** All gates pass for 48+ hours

## Rollback Triggers

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
- Error rate > 0.5%
- p99 latency increase > 5% from baseline
- Any shard CPU/Memory > 95%

### Canary Rollback (< 30 minutes)
- Any primary performance gate fails
- nDCG@10 drops below 0.5184
- SLA-Recall@50 drops below 0.82

### Automated Rollback
- Monitor all gates continuously during rollout
- Automatic revert to previous configuration if triggers fire
- Alert engineering team with specific failure details
