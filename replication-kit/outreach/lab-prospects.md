## Outreach Strategy

### Week 1: Primary Outreach
- Send personalized emails to Tier 1 labs (5 labs)
- Follow up with phone calls if no response within 3 days
- Target: 2-3 confirmed participants

### Week 2: Secondary Outreach  
- Contact Tier 2 labs if needed to fill gaps
- Begin technical support for confirmed participants
- Target: Complete lab selection

### Week 3-4: Execution Support
- Provide technical assistance during reproduction
- Collect results and validate against acceptance criteria
- Process honorarium payments

## Selection Criteria

### Must-Have Requirements
- Docker/containerization expertise
- Graduate student availability (1-2 students)
- Linux system administration capability  
- Academic publication record in relevant areas

### Preferred Qualifications
- Prior experience with benchmark studies
- Information retrieval or systems research background
- Strong reputation for reproducibility and rigor
- Willingness to provide public attestation

## Budget Allocation

- **Lab honorariums:** $2,500 × 3 labs = $7,500
- **Technical support:** $1,000 (internal engineering time)
- **Legal/contracting:** $500 (agreement templates, payment processing)
- **Total budget:** $9,000

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **Participation:** 2-3 academic labs complete reproduction
- ✅ **Validation:** All results within ±0.1 pp tolerance  
- ✅ **Attribution:** Lab names included in public leaderboard
- ✅ **Publication:** Replication results referenced in paper submission
- ✅ **Timeline:** Complete within 4 weeks of initial outreach

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Docker issues:** Provide pre-built images and technical support
- **Resource requirements:** Offer cloud compute credits if needed
- **Reproduction failures:** Debug jointly with lab teams

### Timeline Risks
- **Lab availability:** Start outreach immediately, allow flexible timelines
- **Technical delays:** Build buffer time into acceptance criteria
- **Payment processing:** Set up payment infrastructure early

**Next Action:** Begin Tier 1 outreach immediately with personalized emails
