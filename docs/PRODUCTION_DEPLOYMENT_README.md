## 🔧 Component Details

### 1. Router Distillation (Monotone + INT8)

**Purpose:** Distill complex router policy into production-efficient form

**Features:**
- Monotone GBM with constraints: ∂τ/∂entropy ≥ 0, ∂spend/∂entropy ≥ 0
- 16-segment piecewise linear approximation for runtime efficiency
- INT8 quantization for production deployment
- No-regret validation: LCB(ΔnDCG_distilled - ΔnDCG_full) ≥ -0.05pp

**Usage:**
```python
from production_deployment_package import MonotoneRouterDistiller

distiller = MonotoneRouterDistiller(RouterDistillationConfig())
results = distiller.fit(X_context, y_tau, y_spend, y_gain)
distiller.export_production_config('router_distilled_int8.json')
```

### 2. Confounding Resolution (Enhanced Stratification)

**Purpose:** Fix confounding in observational data through stratification

**Features:**
- Enhanced stratification: {NL-confidence decile × query length × language}
- Within-stratum shuffling to collapse Δ to ~0 within CI
- Negative control validation (must pass p > 0.05)
- ESS/N ≥ 0.2 per slice, κ < 0.5 maintained

**Usage:**
```python
from production_deployment_package import ConfoundingResolver

resolver = ConfoundingResolver(ConfoundingResolutionConfig())
results = resolver.resolve_confounding(observations)
```

### 3. Two-Stage Gating System (θ*-δ Optimization)

**Purpose:** Optimize gating parameters with budget constraints

**Features:**
- θ* determination via ±10% sweep with dual-ascent Lagrangian  
- Two-stage thresholds: θ*-δ for cheap early-exit, θ* for full rerank
- Budget constraint: Expected p95 lift ≤ 0.2ms
- Complete ROC curve generation for performance analysis

**Usage:**
```python
from production_deployment_package import TwoStageGatingOptimizer

optimizer = TwoStageGatingOptimizer(GatingOptimizationConfig())
results = optimizer.optimize_gating_parameters(validation_data)
optimizer.export_gating_config('theta_star_production.json')
```

### 4. Latency Harvest Mode (ANN Knee Alternative)

**Purpose:** Minimize p95 latency while holding ΔnDCG ≥ 0

**Features:**
- Search space: ef ∈ {104, 108, 112}, topk ∈ {80, 88, 96}
- Cold/warm consistency: Sign match requirement across cache regimes
- Jaccard protection: ≥0.80 ranking stability maintained
- Pareto frontier analysis with explicit trade-off documentation

**Usage:**
```python
from production_deployment_package import LatencyHarvestOptimizer

optimizer = LatencyHarvestOptimizer(LatencyHarvestConfig())
results = optimizer.optimize_latency_harvest(validation_data)
optimizer.export_latency_harvest_config('latency_harvest_config.json')
```

### 5. T₁ Release Contract (Mathematical Guards)

**Purpose:** Formal deployment contract with mathematical guarantees

**Features:**
- LCB(ΔnDCG) ≥ 0 global + hard-NL guards
- Performance guards: Δp95 ≤ +1.0ms, p99/p95 ≤ 2
- Stability guards: Jaccard@10 ≥ 0.80, AECE drift ≤ 0.01
- Automatic rollback triggers and recovery protocols

**Usage:**
```python
from production_deployment_package import T1ReleaseContract

contract = T1ReleaseContract(baseline_metrics, production_guards)
results = contract.validate_release_contract(candidate_metrics)
contract.generate_release_contract_document('T1_release_contract.md')
```

### 6. Production Monitoring System

**Purpose:** Real-time validation with automatic rollback protection

**Features:**
- 1-minute resolution guard validation
- Automatic rollback trigger detection
- Comprehensive alerting (WARNING → CRITICAL → EMERGENCY)
- Diagnostic snapshot capture for incident analysis

**Usage:**
```python
from production_deployment_package import ProductionMonitoringSystem

monitoring = ProductionMonitoringSystem(release_contract)
monitoring.start_monitoring()

# Continuous monitoring loop
while True:
    metrics = monitoring.collect_realtime_metrics()
    guard_status = monitoring.validate_guards_realtime(metrics)
    alert = monitoring.generate_alert(guard_status)
```

### 7. Sustainment Loop System (6-Week Cycles)

**Purpose:** Maintain T₁ performance over time through systematic refresh

**Features:**
- Pool refresh with new query/document data
- Counterfactual audit with ESS/κ validation + negative controls
- Conformal coverage check (93-97% per slice target)
- Gating re-optimization with Lagrangian objective
- Artifact updates and validation gallery refresh

**Usage:**
```python
from production_deployment_package import SustainmentLoopSystem

sustainment = SustainmentLoopSystem()
cycle_results = sustainment.execute_sustainment_cycle()
```
