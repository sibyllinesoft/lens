- Threshold: 0.0000

**HARD_NL_NDCG:** ❌ FAIL
- Description: LCB(ΔnDCG) ≥ 0 for hard-NL queries
- Measured: -0.0182
- Threshold: 0.0000

## Performance Guards
Latency and resource utilization constraints.

**P95_LATENCY:** ✅ PASS
- Description: p95 latency ≤ 119.0ms
- Measured: 118.1987
- Threshold: 119.0000

**P99_P95_RATIO:** ✅ PASS
- Description: p99/p95 ratio ≤ 2.0
- Measured: 1.1923
- Threshold: 2.0000

## Stability Guards
Ranking consistency and calibration stability requirements.

**JACCARD_STABILITY:** ✅ PASS

- Threshold: 0.8000

**AECE_DRIFT:** ✅ PASS
- Description: AECE drift ≤ 0.01
- Measured: 0.0002
- Threshold: 0.0100

## Automatic Rollback Triggers

The following conditions trigger automatic rollback:
1. **Quality Regression:** LCB(ΔnDCG) < 0 for 3 consecutive measurement windows
2. **Latency Breach:** p95 latency > 120ms for 5 consecutive minutes
3. **Stability Loss:** Jaccard@10 < 0.75 indicating ranking collapse
4. **Calibration Drift:** AECE > 0.02 indicating confidence miscalibration

## Recovery Protocols

**Immediate Actions:**
- Route 100% traffic to T₀ baseline configuration
- Capture diagnostic snapshots for post-incident analysis
- Alert on-call engineering team within 2 minutes

**Investigation Phase:**
- Root cause analysis within 24 hours
- Corrective action plan within 48 hours
- Re-validation against contract terms before re-deployment

## Continuous Monitoring Requirements

**Real-time Metrics (1-minute resolution):**
- Global and hard-NL nDCG with 95% confidence intervals
- p95 and p99 latency across all traffic segments
- Jaccard@10 ranking stability measurement
- AECE calibration quality assessment

**Alert Thresholds:**
- WARNING: Any guard within 10% of threshold
- CRITICAL: Any guard threshold breached
- EMERGENCY: Two or more guards breached simultaneously

## DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED

❌ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED**

One or more mathematical guards have failed. The candidate
configuration does not meet T₁ release contract requirements.
