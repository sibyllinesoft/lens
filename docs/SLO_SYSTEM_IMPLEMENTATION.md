# SLO System Implementation - Comprehensive Calibration Governance

## Overview

A production-ready Service Level Objectives (SLO) system for calibration governance has been successfully implemented, providing real-time monitoring, comprehensive dashboards, and automated alerting for calibration systems.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Core SLO System (`src/calibration/slo_system.rs`)

**Comprehensive SLO Definition and Enforcement:**
- **ECE Bound**: ≤ max(0.015, ĉ√(K/N)) with statistical threshold calculation
- **Clamp Activation**: ≤10% across all slices to prevent over-calibration
- **Merged Bin Warning**: ≤5% (warning), >20% (failure) for binning health
- **P99 Latency**: <1ms for calibration operations performance monitoring
- **Weekly Drift Deltas**: All metrics <0.01 absolute change for stability
- **Score Range Validation**: All scores ∈ [0,1] for data integrity
- **Clamp Alpha Changes**: <0.05 week-over-week for calibration stability

**Real-time Monitoring Architecture:**
- Continuous SLO measurement loop with configurable intervals
- Automated breach detection with multi-level alert escalation
- Trend analysis with predictive time-to-breach calculations
- Historical breach tracking with MTTR and availability metrics

### 2. Interactive Dashboard System (`src/calibration/slo_dashboard.rs`)

**Comprehensive Visualization Components:**
- **SLO Overview**: System health indicators, status cards, metrics summary
- **Reliability Charts**: Time-series SLO compliance with breach markers
- **Calibration Tables**: Per-bin analysis with mask mismatch detection
- **Drift Analysis**: Weekly delta reporting with trend prediction
- **Alert Panel**: Active alert management with escalation tracking

**Export and Integration Capabilities:**
- Multiple export formats: JSON, CSV, PNG, SVG, PDF, HTML

- Resource leak prevention with proper cleanup logic

## Usage Examples

### Basic SLO System Setup

```rust
use lens::calibration::{SloSystem, CalibrationGovernance, CalibrationMonitor, DriftMonitor};
use std::sync::Arc;

// Create integrated SLO system
let governance = Arc::new(CalibrationGovernance::new(config).await?);
let monitor = Arc::new(CalibrationMonitor::new(monitor_config).await?);
let drift_monitor = Arc::new(DriftMonitor::new().await?);

let slo_system = SloSystem::new(governance, monitor, drift_monitor);
slo_system.start_monitoring().await?;
```

### Dashboard Creation and Export

```rust
use lens::calibration::{SloDashboard, slo_dashboard::ExportFormat};

// Create dashboard with custom configuration
let dashboard = SloDashboard::with_config(slo_system, dashboard_config);
dashboard.start().await?;

// Export data in multiple formats
let json_data = dashboard.export(ExportFormat::Json, None).await?;
let csv_data = dashboard.export(ExportFormat::Csv, Some(filters)).await?;
```

### Real-time SLO Monitoring

```rust
// Get current SLO state
let state = slo_system.get_slo_state().await;
println!("System Health: {:?}", state.overall_health);

for (slo_type, status) in &state.slo_status {
    println!("{}: {:.3} (target: {:.3})", 
        slo_type.name(), status.current_value, status.target_value);
}

// Generate comprehensive report
let report = slo_system.generate_report().await?;
```
