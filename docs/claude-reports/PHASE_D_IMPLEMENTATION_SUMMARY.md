# Phase D Implementation Summary - Lens v1.0 Rollout & Monitoring

## 🎯 Implementation Overview

Phase D of the lens v1.0 rollout has been successfully implemented with comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, canary deployment system, monitoring infrastructure, and operational readiness. This implementation fulfills all requirements specified in the TODO.md Phase D section.

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. Release Candidate Infrastructure ✅

**RC Release Manager** (`src/core/rc-release-manager.ts`)
- Comprehensive RC build with SBOM/SAST/provenance
- Container build and security scanning
- Quality pre-flight checks
- Artifact generation and validation

**CLI Commands** (`src/cli.ts`)
```bash
lens build --sbom --provenance --lock     # Secure build
lens cut-rc --version 1.0.0-rc.1         # Cut RC release
lens compat-drill                         # Compatibility testing
lens nightly-validation                   # Three-night validation
lens check-signoff                        # Sign-off status
lens promote --version 1.0.0-rc.1        # Production promotion
```

### 2. Compatibility Check System ✅

**API Endpoint** (`/compat/check`)
```bash
GET /compat/check?api_version=v1&index_version=v1
```
- SemVer compliance validation
- Backward compatibility verification  
- Migration path testing
- <10ms SLA compliance

### 3. Kill-Switch Feature Flags ✅

**Canary Deployment Flags** (`src/core/feature-flags.ts`)
```typescript
stageA: {
  native_scanner: boolean  // SIMD scanner control
}
stageB: {
  enabled: boolean        // Symbol/AST optimizations
  lruCaching: boolean     // LRU cache control
  precompilePatterns: boolean
}
stageC: {
  enabled: boolean        // Reranking optimizations
  confidenceCutoff: boolean
  isotonicCalibration: boolean
}
canary: {
  trafficPercentage: 5→25→100  // Progressive rollout
  killSwitchEnabled: boolean   // Emergency control
  progressiveRollout: boolean
}
```

### 4. Canary Deployment API ✅

**Deployment Control Endpoints**
```bash
GET  /canary/status           # Current deployment status
POST /canary/progress         # Progress 5% → 25% → 100%
POST /canary/killswitch       # Emergency rollback to 0%
```

**Progressive Rollout Logic**
- Deterministic user bucketing (hash-based)
- 5% → 25% → 100% progression
- Automatic rollback on SLA breaches
- Kill switch with immediate effect

### 5. Monitoring Dashboard System ✅

**Comprehensive Metrics** (`src/monitoring/phase-d-dashboards.ts`)
- Per-stage p95/p99 latency tracking
- Span coverage monitoring (≥98% requirement)
- LSIF coverage tracking 
- Semantic gating rate monitoring
- Real-time alert management
- On-call escalation integration

**Dashboard API** (`/monitoring/dashboard`)
```bash
GET /monitoring/dashboard     # Real-time system status
```

### 6. Automated Quality Gates ✅

**Quality Validation System** (`src/core/quality-gates.ts`)
- **Release Gates**: SemVer, compatibility, UPGRADE.md, security
- **Performance Gates**: Stage-A ≤5ms p95, tail latency ≤2×p95
- **Quality Gates**: Span coverage ≥98%, nDCG@10 ≥+2%, Recall@50 ≥baseline
- **Stability Gates**: Zero consistency violations, LSIF coverage maintenance
- **Operational Gates**: Live docs, alert config, kill switches, on-call

**Quality Gates API**
```bash
POST /validation/quality-gates  # Run all quality gates
```

### 7. Three-Night Validation System ✅

**Automated Sign-off Process** (`src/core/three-night-validation.ts`)
- Nightly comprehensive validation across repo slices
- Multi-language and repo-type coverage
- Consecutive pass requirement (3 nights)
- Automatic sign-off eligibility determination
- Stakeholder approval tracking

**Validation APIs**
```bash
POST /validation/nightly          # Execute nightly validation
GET  /validation/status           # Current validation status
GET  /validation/signoff-report   # Comprehensive sign-off report
```

### 8. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline ✅

**Complete Workflow** (`.github/workflows/phase-d-rollout.yml`)
- RC build and artifact generation
- Compatibility drill automation
- Nightly validation scheduling
- Production promotion with gates
- Emergency rollback procedures

**Workflow Triggers**
- RC tags: `v*-rc.*` 
- Scheduled: Nightly at 2 AM UTC
- Manual: Workflow dispatch with options

### 9. Operational Readiness ✅

**Comprehensive Runbook** (`OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK.md`)
- SLA definitions and monitoring
- Alert thresholds and response procedures
- Incident response playbooks
- Emergency contact information
- Troubleshooting guides
- On-call rotation structure

**Integration Testing** (`src/__tests__/phase-d-integration.test.ts`)
- End-to-end rollout scenario validation
- Emergency kill switch testing
- Quality gates validation
- Three-night validation testing
- Monitoring system integration

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Starting a Phase D Rollout

1. **Cut Release Candidate**
```bash
npm run rc:cut
# Or manually:
lens cut-rc --version 1.0.0-rc.1 --sbom --provenance
```

2. **Run Compatibility Drill**
```bash
npm run rc:compat-drill
# Or manually:
lens compat-drill --previous-versions v0.9.0,v0.9.1,v0.9.2
```

3. **Begin Nightly Validation**
```bash
npm run rc:nightly
# Or manually:
lens nightly-validation --duration 120
```

### Managing Canary Deployment

1. **Check Current Status**
```bash
npm run phase-d:canary-status
# Shows: traffic %, kill switch status, stage flags
```

2. **Progress Rollout** (when metrics are healthy)
```bash
npm run phase-d:progress-canary
# Progresses: 5% → 25% → 100%
```

3. **Emergency Kill Switch**
```bash
npm run phase-d:kill-switch
# Immediately sets traffic to 0%, disables all stages
```

### Monitoring & Validation

1. **Real-time Dashboard**
```bash
npm run phase-d:dashboard
# Shows: performance metrics, SLA compliance, alerts
```

2. **Quality Gates Check**
```bash
npm run phase-d:quality-gates
# Validates all acceptance criteria
```

3. **Validation Status**
```bash
npm run phase-d:validation-status
# Shows three-night validation progress
```

4. **Sign-off Report**
```bash
npm run phase-d:signoff-report
# Comprehensive promotion readiness report
```

### Production Promotion

1. **Check Sign-off Status**
```bash
npm run rc:check-signoff
# Must show: promotion_ready: true
```

2. **Promote to Production** (requires sign-off)
```bash
npm run rc:promote
# Creates v1.0.0 from v1.0.0-rc.1
```
