## ðŸ›  Incident Response Procedures

### Kill Switch Activation

**When to Activate:**
- Critical performance regression (Stage-A p95 >10ms)
- Quality degradation (span coverage <95%)
- High error rates (>10%)
- Security incidents
- System instability

**Activation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Immediate kill switch activation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/canary/killswitch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Performance regression - Stage-A p95 exceeds 10ms"}'

# 2. Verify traffic rollback
curl http://localhost:3000/canary/status | jq '.canary_deployment.trafficPercentage'
# Expected: 0

# 3. Monitor system recovery
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.health.status'
```

**Post-Activation:**
1. Create incident report in GitHub Issues
2. Notify all stakeholders via Slack/Email
3. Begin root cause analysis
4. Plan remediation strategy
5. Document lessons learned

### Progressive Rollout Management

**Normal Progression (5% â†’ 25% â†’ 100%):**
```bash
# Check current status
curl http://localhost:3000/canary/status

# Progress to next stage (only if metrics are healthy)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/canary/progress

# Verify progression success
curl http://localhost:3000/canary/status | jq '.canary_deployment.nextStage'
```

**Rollback Procedure:**
```bash
# Immediate rollback to previous stage
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/canary/killswitch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Manual rollback - quality concerns"}'

# Verify rollback
curl http://localhost:3000/canary/status | jq '.canary_deployment'
```

### Quality Gate Failures

**Response to Quality Gate Failure:**
```bash
# 1. Run immediate quality assessment  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/validation/quality-gates

# 2. Check specific failed gates
curl http://localhost:3000/validation/quality-gates | jq '.quality_gates_report.blocking_issues'

# 3. Generate recommendations
curl http://localhost:3000/validation/quality-gates | jq '.quality_gates_report.recommendations'
```

**Common Quality Issues & Solutions:**

| Issue | Symptoms | Immediate Action | Long-term Fix |
|-------|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Span coverage drop | <98% coverage | Investigate indexing completeness | Review parser updates |
| Latency regression | p95 >5ms Stage-A | Enable native scanner flag | Optimize lexical processing |
| Consistency violations | Inconsistent results | Review recent model changes | Revalidate training data |
| LSIF coverage drop | Symbol resolution issues | Check language server health | Update language definitions |

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Guide

### Performance Issues

**Stage-A Latency (>5ms p95)**
```bash
# Check current latency metrics
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.metrics.performance.stageA'

# Enable native SIMD scanner (emergency optimization)
# This requires feature flag adjustment - contact platform team

# Check early termination rates
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.metrics.performance.stageA.early_termination_rate'
```

**Stage-B Symbol Processing Issues**
```bash
# Check LSIF coverage
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.metrics.performance.stageB.lsif_coverage_percent'

# Verify cache hit rates
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.metrics.performance.stageB.lru_cache_hit_rate'

# Pattern compilation time check
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.metrics.performance.stageB.pattern_compile_time_ms'
```

**Stage-C Reranking Problems**
```bash
# Check semantic gating rates
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.metrics.performance.stageC.semantic_gating_rate'

# Confidence cutoff validation
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.metrics.performance.stageC.confidence_cutoff_rate'
```

### System Health Checks

**Overall Health Status:**
```bash
# Comprehensive health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health | jq '.'

# Dashboard health summary
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.health'

# Active alerts summary
curl http://localhost:3000/monitoring/dashboard | jq '.dashboard_state.recent_alerts'
```

**Compatibility Verification:**
```bash
# API compatibility check
curl "http://localhost:3000/compat/check?api_version=v1&index_version=v1"

# Bundle compatibility validation
curl "http://localhost:3000/compat/bundles?allow_compat=false"
```
