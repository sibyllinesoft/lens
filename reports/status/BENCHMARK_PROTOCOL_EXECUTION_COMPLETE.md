- **BM25+Proximity**: 100% compliance (0 timeouts)
- **Hybrid**: 83.3% compliance (6 timeouts out of 36 queries)

## 📋 Benchmark Suite Coverage

### Query Suites Evaluated:
1. **CoIR** (Code Information Retrieval): 10 queries - semantic, identifier, structural search patterns
2. **SWE-bench Verified**: 8 queries - software engineering bug-finding and debugging scenarios  
3. **CSN** (CodeSearchNet): 10 queries - natural language code search tasks
4. **CoSQA** (Code Search Q&A): 8 queries - question-answering style code queries

### Intent Distribution:
- **Semantic queries**: 26 queries (natural language descriptions)
- **Identifier queries**: 6 queries (exact symbol matching)  
- **Structural queries**: 4 queries (code pattern matching)

## 🔍 Performance Gap Analysis

**Lens vs BM25 (baseline):**
- **Response time improvement**: -15.3ms (27% faster)
- **nDCG improvement**: +0.199 (42% better search quality)
- **SLA compliance**: No change (both 100%)
- **Overall assessment**: Superior performance

**Key Insights:**
- Lens achieves significantly better search quality while maintaining fastest response times
- BM25+Proximity shows meaningful improvement over baseline BM25 (+0.093 nDCG)
- Hybrid approach trades speed for quality but fails SLA compliance threshold
