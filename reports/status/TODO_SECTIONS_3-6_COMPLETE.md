## 🔄 Next Steps & Sprint-2 Deployment

### Sprint-2 Activation (When Ready)
Currently **DISABLED** per TODO.md "don't ship yet" directive. When ready to deploy:

```typescript
// Enable Sprint-2 for production traffic
await system.enableSprint2ForProduction();

// Rollback if issues detected
await system.disableSprint2Rollback();
```

### Gate Validation Required
Before Sprint-2 activation, ensure:
- ✅ +1-2pp improvement on lexical slices
- ✅ ≤ +0.5ms increase in p95 latency  
- ✅ All Pareto curve points within acceptable quality/latency tradeoffs
- ✅ Config hash reproducibility validated

### Monitoring Post-Sprint-2
- **Gate Compliance**: Continuous validation of improvement metrics
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time latency and recall monitoring
- **Rollback Readiness**: Automated rollback on gate violations
- **A/B Testing**: Gradual traffic ramp with performance comparison
