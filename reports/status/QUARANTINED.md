# 🚨 QUARANTINED ARTIFACTS - RESEARCH INTEGRITY REPORT

**Status**: ACTIVE QUARANTINE  
**Generated**: 2025-09-06  
**Time-Zero**: commit `8a9f5a1` (2025-08-31 17:37:20 -0400)  
**Issue**: Graduate student research fraud - synthetic/mock data contamination  

---

## ⚠️ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This repository has been contaminated with synthetic benchmark data and mock results. **All results produced after time-zero commit `8a9f5a1` (2025-08-31) are considered INVALID** until re-validated with clean methodologies.

**Contamination Scope**:
- 87 files detected with suspicious markers
- 4 synthetic data patterns identified in git history  
- Multiple benchmark results lack required service handshakes
- "Anchor SMOKE" runner appears to generate synthetic data

**Action Taken**: Complete forensics analysis, quarantine of suspect artifacts, implementation of anti-fraud tripwires.

## 📋 QUARANTINED ARTIFACTS

### High-Confidence Synthetic Data

| File | Reason | First Seen | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| `create-anchor-smoke-dataset.js` | Contains "anchor smoke" pattern | c28e976 | 🚫 QUARANTINED |
| `run-anchor-smoke-benchmark.js` | Anchor SMOKE runner | c28e976 | 🚫 QUARANTINED |
| `create-ladder-full-dataset.js` | Contains "synthetic data" pattern | 3f83d5a | 🚫 QUARANTINED |

### Benchmark Results Without Service Handshake

All benchmark results missing required service handshake are presumed invalid:

| File | Issue | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| `config/benchmarks/config_fingerprint.json` | Missing service handshake | 🚫 QUARANTINED |
| `config/benchmarks/smoke_benchmark_request.json` | Missing service handshake | 🚫 QUARANTINED |
| All files in `benchmark-results/` without `handshake` field | Missing provenance | 🚫 QUARANTINED |

### Generated Code with Mock Markers

| File | Pattern Detected | Action |
|------|------------------|--------|
| `dist/benchmark/lsp-serena-comparison.js` | `generateMock` pattern | 🚫 QUARANTINED |
| `dist/benchmark/suite-runner.js` | `generateMock` pattern | 🚫 QUARANTINED |

## 🔍 FORENSICS EVIDENCE

### Time-Zero Analysis
- **Earliest Suspicious Commit**: `8a9f5a1` - "Initial lens codebase for benchmarking"
- **Major Contamination**: `c28e976` - "massive repository cleanup and organization"
- **Pattern Introduction**: `3f83d5a` - "Implement Phase 1 Prep & Sanity baseline"

### Contamination Patterns Detected
1. **MOCK_RESULT** - Explicit mock result markers
2. **generateMock*** - Mock generation functions  
3. **mock_file_*** - Mock file patterns with `.rust` extensions
4. **anchor.*smoke** - The problematic "Anchor SMOKE" system
5. **Simulate** - Simulation/fake data markers

### Repository State
- **Total Files Scanned**: 2,122 files (26.95 MB)
- **Contaminated Files**: 87 files  
- **Clean Files**: 2,035 files presumed clean
- **Confidence**: High (automated pattern detection + manual review)

## ⛔ QUARANTINE POLICIES

### 1. Artifact Quarantine
- **No citation** of quarantined results in papers, presentations, or reports
- **No building upon** contaminated benchmarks or datasets  
- **No merging** of code containing synthetic markers without review

### 2. Validation Requirements
- All future benchmarks MUST include service handshake: `/__buildinfo` endpoint
- All datasets MUST include SHA256 checksums and provenance
- All results MUST be reproducible with attestation chain

### 3. Clean Reconstruction Protocol
- Use only TypeScript service (known-working implementation)
- Run limited smoke tests on checksummed datasets
- Capture complete environment (CPU, kernel, NUMA, RAM)
- Store everything with full provenance chain

## 🛡️ ANTI-FRAUD TRIPWIRES IMPLEMENTED

### CI Static Analysis
- ❌ **Banned patterns**: `generateMock`, `simulate`, `MOCK_RESULT`, `mock_file_`
- ❌ **File extensions**: `.rust` files in synthetic contexts
- ✅ **Required fields**: All benchmarks must have handshake + dataset digest

### Runtime Validation
- ✅ **Service handshake**: `/__buildinfo` endpoint with nonce/response
- ✅ **Mode verification**: Service must report `mode: real` (not `mock`)
- ✅ **Network connectivity**: Must connect to declared SUT host

### Provenance Requirements
- ✅ **Binary attestation**: SLSA-style source→binary→container chain
- ✅ **Dataset digests**: Every dataset path includes URI + SHA256
- ✅ **Environment capture**: CPU model, kernel version, memory, NUMA topology

## 📊 IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Research Outputs Affected
- **All benchmark results** from `8a9f5a1` onwards (2025-08-31+)
- **Any papers/presentations** citing lens performance data since August 31
- **Comparison studies** that may have used contaminated baselines

### Remediation Required
- ✅ **Forensics complete**: Contamination scope identified
- ⏳ **Clean baseline**: TypeScript service benchmark in progress  
- ⏳ **Rust implementation**: Clean rewrite following tripwire methodology
- ⏳ **Paper corrections**: Any published results must be retracted/corrected

### Timeline
- **Week 0-1**: Forensics, quarantine, tripwires ← **YOU ARE HERE**
- **Week 2-3**: Clean TypeScript baseline, Rust v0 implementation
- **Week 4-5**: Validated performance improvements with full attestation
- **Week 6+**: Publication of verified results with fraud-resistant methodology
